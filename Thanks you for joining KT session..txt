Thanks you for joining KT session.

I have been actively involved in this project, overseeing key aspects such as requirement analysis and technical implementation.

The purpose of this session is to provide you with comprehensive understanding of the FDM.

We will discuss project objectives, architecture, key functionalities and technical components.

This is a quick overview of the agenda.

FDM follows Double-entry bookkeeping method. It means every transaction has two-sided entries to maintain financial information. Each entry has a debit side and a credit side, and sum of both credit and debit amount must be zero.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns. We'll do our best to respond.

Since the reconciliation issue occurred in production on 12 Dec 2024 and after that so many transactions loaded into FDM and posting also done for different processes. 

Initially we suggested to do the reversal of Journal causing this issue. But Jacob is not willing to do that.
Generally we do the data fix by deleting all the transactions from the point the issue
