VISUAL INTERACTIONS	:	SELECTION OF HIGHLIGHT OF DATA POINT IN ONE VISUAL WILL AUTO FILTER OTHER VISUALS IN SAME PAGE. 
EDIT INTERACTIONS	:	TO DISABLE VISUAL INTERACTIONS

SLICER			:	SELECTION OF HIGHLIGHT OF DATA POINT IN ONE VISUAL WILL AUTO FILTER OTHER VISUALS IN SAME PAGE.  SELECTION CONTROLS
VISUAL SYNC		:	SELECTION OF HIGHLIGHT OF DATA POINT IN ONE VISUAL WILL AUTO FILTER OTHER VISUALS IN OTHER PAGES.

GROUPING		:	COMBINE MULTIPLE VALUES OF A REPROT FIELD. CHARACER BASED, STATIC VALUES
BINNING			:	COMBINE MULTIPLE VALUES OF A REPROT FIELD. INTEGER BASED, RANGE VALUES

HIERARCHIES		:	GROUP MULTIPLE FIELDS FOR EASY ACCESS
DRILLDOWS		:	TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN ONE LEVEL TO ANOTHER WITHIN A HIERARCHY (COUNTRY, COMPANY, QARTER, MONTH..)

FITLERS			:	TO SPECIFY CONDITIONS FOR DATA REPORTING [VISUAL LEVEL, PAGE LEVEL, REPORT LEVEL]
DRILLTHRU		:	TO SPECIFY CONDITIONS FOR DATA REPORTING ACROSS SPECIFIC PAGES BASED ON DATA POINT & BUTTON NAVIGATIONS 


YOU NEED TO SPECIFY THE TECHNIQUE(S) YOU USE FOR EACH OF THE BELOW SCENARIOS:
	SCENARIO 1:	IF WE NEED A COMMON CONDITION ACROSS ALL PAGES OF THE REPORT:	

	SCENARIO 2:	IF WE NEED A COMMON CONDITION ACROSS ALL VISUALS OF THE PAGE:	

	SCENARIO 3:	IF WE NEED A COMMON CONDITION ACROSS FEW VISUALS IN A PAGE:

	SCENARIO 4:	IF WE NEED HIGHLIGHT ONE OR FEW DATA POINTS AND GREY-OUT / HIDE REMAINING: 

	SCENARIO 5:	IF WE NEED HIDE A SPECIFIC DATA POINT OR A VALUE: 

	SCENARIO 6:	IF WE NEED DRILL DOWN TO NEXT LEVEL IN A HIERARCHY BASED ON CLICK ON A SPECIFIC DATA POINT:
